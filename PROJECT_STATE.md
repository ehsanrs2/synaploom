# PROJECT_STATE — SynapLoom

> This file is the authoritative project memory. Update it in every PR that changes architecture, experiment status, accepted assumptions, or the next milestone.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-05  
**Repository:** ehsanrs2/synaploom  
**Current stage:** M1 design complete; implementation not started  
**Research status:** M0 merged; M1 implementation specification prepared; no experimental results yet

## 1. Project objective

Investigate a brain-inspired adaptive neural graph in which pre-existing reserve capacity can be recruited, routed, consolidated, pruned, and associated across modalities during continual learning.

Primary target problems:
- continual learning
- loss of plasticity
- catastrophic forgetting
- multimodal specialization and association
- conditional/sparse computation

## 2. Current architecture baseline

Accepted for v0.1:

- fixed total microcircuit capacity
- microcircuit-level graph nodes, not biological-neuron-level nodes
- node states: DORMANT, PLASTIC, CONSOLIDATED
- recruited structural capacity is separate from runtime executed capacity
- modality-private pathways in later multimodal milestones
- sparse conditional top-k routing
- M1 uses batch-level routing
- structural updates happen on a slower schedule than gradient updates
- backpropagation through executed paths for the first prototype
- growth means recruiting pre-existing dormant capacity
- normal runtime routing scores recruited nodes only
- dormant recruitment is controlled by the structural controller
- logical supergraph is represented with bounded edge slots, not a dense N x N adjacency matrix
- default edge transform is scalar gate + shared relation projection
- automatic calibrated novelty growth remains M2
- cross-modal association requires more than temporal co-occurrence

## 3. Explicit non-claims

We do NOT currently claim:

- SynapLoom is the first dynamic/brain-inspired graph network
- knowledge is proven to be stored as subgraphs
- the architecture is biologically faithful
- sparse routing automatically reduces wall-clock time
- reserve capacity is memory-free
- multimodal private pathways are necessarily superior
- structural growth solves catastrophic forgetting
- local learning is required
- recruited-capacity growth will be sublinear
- graph topology will converge

All are empirical/theoretical questions.

## 4. Foundation architecture corrections

1. Dynamic topology is represented within fixed total model capacity.
2. Removed the extra STABLE node state from the MVP.
3. Rejected per-edge full dense matrices as the default.
4. Rejected raw co-occurrence as sufficient cross-modal association evidence.
5. Rejected a single hand-weighted novelty scalar as the default growth trigger.
6. Separated loss of plasticity from catastrophic forgetting.
7. Deferred dendrites, spiking, neuromodulation, and local predictive learning.
8. Split validation into single-modality structural learning first, multimodal claims later.

## 5. M1 design decisions

1. Separate recruited nodes from executed nodes.
2. Keep executed expert count k bounded even when recruited capacity grows.
3. Use batch-level top-k routing first; per-sample dispatch is deferred.
4. Score only recruited nodes during normal routing.
5. Treat dormant nodes as exchangeable before recruitment in M1.
6. Recruit a deterministic free node and imprint its routing key from triggering context.
7. Materialize topology as O(N q_max) bounded edge slots.
8. Use scalar edge gates plus a shared relation projection by default.
9. Use synchronous bounded message-passing rounds.
10. Mutate structural state only after optimizer.step under no_grad.
11. Implement policy interfaces with scheduled/task-boundary policies before adaptive novelty policies.
12. Apply consolidation with per-node gradient scaling rather than dynamic optimizer groups.
13. Use typed Python dataclasses as canonical configuration; YAML may supply run configs.
14. Use a src/ package layout with unit/integration tests.
15. Treat Split CIFAR-100 class-incremental as the current first scientific benchmark candidate after toy/smoke tests.

## 6. Mathematical/computational position

SynapLoom is currently viewed as a:

- mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem
- non-convex online learner
- hybrid dynamical system with multiple timescales
- dynamic sparse graph under capacity constraints

Target M1 forward cost, excluding encoder/head, is approximately:

O(B A d + B k d h + K B k q d)

for recruited nodes A, executed top-k nodes k, representation width d, microcircuit hidden width h, bounded degree q, and K message rounds.

Total microcircuit parameter memory remains approximately O(N d h); dormant capacity is not memory-free.

See docs/THEORY.md for assumptions and open questions.

## 7. No experimental results yet

There are currently:

- no training runs
- no benchmark results
- no accuracy claims
- no compute claims
- no ablation results

Future results must be recorded in docs/EXPERIMENT_LOG.md.

## 8. Immediate next milestone

**Implement M1.0 — execution and state machinery**

Required components:

- package/config scaffold
- GraphState with registered structural buffers
- MicroCircuit
- batch-level SparseRouter
- bounded edge-slot representation
- GraphExecutor
- typed ModelOutput / ForwardTrace
- event logger
- exact checkpoint contract
- invariant unit tests

Then M1.1 adds controlled scheduled recruitment and optional task-boundary consolidation.

## 9. Open design questions

Still unresolved:

- exact default d, h, N, k, q_max, K
- exact load-balancing loss
- whether the initial scientific run should include message passing or first isolate node recruitment
- exact structural schedule for the controlled M1.1 experiment
- consolidation coefficient and importance EMA hyperparameters
- first fair dynamic-sparse baseline implementation
- exact Split CIFAR-100 stream protocol
- exact fairness reporting table
- when to introduce sample-level or hierarchical routing

## 10. Documentation rule

For every merged milestone PR:

1. Update this file.
2. Update architecture/design docs if a decision changes.
3. Add all experiment commands/results to docs/EXPERIMENT_LOG.md.
4. Update docs/ROADMAP.md checkboxes.
5. State the next action explicitly.

The repository, not chat history, is the source of truth.
